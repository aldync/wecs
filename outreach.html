		<h3>Victoria/Saanich Girl Guides Outreach Program</h3>
        <p>This will be our 4th consecutive year running our Outreach Program for Victoria Girl Guides. Upon invites by troupe leaders, we visit Brownies and Guides at their usual meeting locations, to introduce them to the world of Engineering and Computer Science. Our workshops are all hands-on with games, building activities, and even a bit of magic! We encourage participants to ask questions and share their discoveries with the group, so that everyone can have fun together and learn as much as possible!</p>
		<p>Our goal when visiting troupes is to introduce them to Engineering and Computer Science as fun and accessible areas of interest. Through discussions with many of our members, we realize these career choices tend to come across as confusing, overwhelming, and sometimes even boring. Even worse, many students are never exposed to the fields at all. We aim to share our passion for Engineering and Computer Science with the Victoria youth, to combat the negative stigma and encourage greater gender diversity in these and other technical fields.</p>
		<p>Our workshop season runs from February-April.</p>
