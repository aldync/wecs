        <h2>CSC Revealed</h2>
        <p>Our CSC Revealed Clinics run throughout the year to help students in first year CSC classes prepare for midterms and work through core course concepts. Our coordinators work with lab instructors and course professors/TA's to gather the most important or troubling concepts for students, then run sessions in the computer labs in ECS to work through examples and answer as many questions as possible!</p>
